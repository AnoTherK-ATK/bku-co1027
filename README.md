# BKU_1027 assignments

> This is my first big project, I think that.

## Some trash talk
Well yes, this is a big assignment from Bach Khoa University, I just wanted to solve it.

## How to use and how to "legally" submit
Just delete all the comments in the product/knight.cpp file and submit knight.h and knight.cpp only
~~I don't want a lecturer will see all the comments~~

## :important: IMPORTANT NOTE:
READ ALL THE CODE AND UNDERSTAND IT PLEASE.
